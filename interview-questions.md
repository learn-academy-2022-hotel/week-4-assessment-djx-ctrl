# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: From my knowledge object-oriented programming focuses on objects. Functional programming focuses on functions.

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a computer programming model that organizes software design around objects instead of functions and logic. There are 4 main principles of OOP which are Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Functional programming is where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions to create new functions.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Float is when you will have a decimal place and a integer is equivalent to any whole number.

Researched answer: In Ruby, Floats are used when you want to return a non whole number and it has a decimal place. Integers represent whole numbers in Ruby.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: From my own knowledge I'm not sure of the answer.

Researched answer: From researching, Implicit Return means every block in ruby will return the value of the last line automatically. So you don't have to use the return keyword to get a return.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby is defined by do and end.

Researched answer: A Ruby block is an anonymous function that is passed to a method to get outcome. Blocks are defined by the keywords do and end typically or can be between curly braces if for a single line of code and also can have multiple arguments.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: From my own knowledge I'm not sure of the answer.

Researched answer: To extract a value in a Ruby hash you have to use 
.values and it will return an array with only the values. You would type out p then your varible_name.values and the output would be an array of the values in the hash.
